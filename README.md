# AboutMe_React_Portfolio

#Description

React: React Portfolio

The purpose of this application was to create a dynamic porfolio that a user can react with to view information about me and 
what work I have accomplished. My porfolio allows potential employers in the future to be able to view my react porfolio see 
who I am as a future web developer and how to contact me. This application shows the complex ways and some of the many ways 
to use react and show the differences from where I was as a starting developer compared to now.

#Mock_UP

Please view the link below that shows my Portfolio working.

#Usage

Other developers can expand uponh this react portfolio to create other applications such eccommerce websites,
autobiographies, an interactive book for children and adults, etc. Future development for this application would
be animations, favicons, more external links, a map for my future employment location, etc.
